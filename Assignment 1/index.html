            <h2>WHY DID YOU JOIN ALTSCHOOL SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING PROGRAM?</h2>
            <p>In the course of my search for schools, I came across Altschool in one of the social media sites. To enable me make my decisions, I prowled through Youtube, listening to testimonials of previous students. <p>
            <p>However, the main reason I joined Altschool is because the tutors and the head of the school are Nigerian. Being a Nigerian in the diaspora, we don't have a lot of options for learning here.<p> 
            <p>There are people from different nationalities who teach these courses but their accents are difficult to understand, mode of delivery lacking, or the course prices ridiculously expensive so it was a no-brainer to join this school.
