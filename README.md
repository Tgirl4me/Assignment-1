 This is a web page that displays my basic information, with ALT SCHOOL ID, a biography, relevant details explaining why I joined the program, and my goals for the School of Engineering program.
 A fragment identifier feature was implemented to enable scrolling back to the top of the page. A folder was created and named index.html.
 
 A second html file was created consisting of a form that mirrors the ALT SCHOOL application form (https://portal.altschoolafrica.com/auth/create-account). It was named form.htm and the form.html was connected to my
 first assignment via global navigation ensuring both files are in the folder of the first assignment, which should be at the top of both pages. You should create a footer with your address and a copyright. 
 Folder is accessible, incorporating appropriate semantic HTML tags.

 Initially we were asked to create html files without CSS but Instructor requested to also incorporate CSS in subsequent classes. This CSS file is called style.css
